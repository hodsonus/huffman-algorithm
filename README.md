# huffman-algorithm

third and final data structures and algorithms (cop3530) project. 

given a .txt file, it uses the huffman algorithm to encode the characters that compose the file into a sting of 0s and 1s based on character frequency. frequent characters use less space while rare characters use more.

uses a variety of different data structures. includes min heaps for use as a priority queue, hash maps with a perfect hashing function, and huffman trees. culmination of all skills accquired thus far, uses a good amount of string manipulation and object oriented programming techniques as well.
