I am a passionate and driven individual whose interests include thinking, learning, reading, physical fitness, sports, spearfishing, and enjoying nature.
As far as technical interests go, I am interested in software development and am particularly intrigued by the Machine Learning and Data Science fields.
I strive every day to become the best version of myself, in all facets of life.
